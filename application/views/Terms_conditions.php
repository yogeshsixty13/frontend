                                <li>WoWtasks.com (Owned by Enegra Systems Inc, Canada) provides the WoWtasks Platform to enable Task Owners to publish Tasks.s</li>
                                <li>Taskers / Service Providers / Service Providing Companies (collectively known as Tasker) may make an Bid in response to a Posted Task. Some parts of Bid details may be made publicly available, including to internet users who are not Users.</li>
                                <li>A Task Owner may revoke or modify a Posted Task at any time before he/she accepts an Bid. WoWtasks reserves the right to cancel all Bids on a Posted Task made prior to the modification.</li>
                                <li> If a Task Owner accepts a Bid on the WoWtasks Platform, a Task Contract is created between the Tasker and the Task Owner.</li>
                                <li>Upon creation of a Task Contract, the Task Owner must pay the Agreed Price into the Payment Account.</li>
                                <li>Upon creation of the Task Contract, WoWtasks has rendered WoWtasks Services and the Service Fee is due and payable.</li>
                                <li>Once the Task Contract is created, the Tasker and Task Owner may vary the Task Contract on the WoWtasks Platform. The Task Owner and Tasker are encouraged to use WoWtasks's private chat system to amend or vary the Task Contract (including the Agreed Price) or to otherwise communicate.</li>
                                <li>Once the Services are complete, the Tasker must provide notice of that on the WoWtasks Platform.</li>
                                <li>Once the Services are complete, the Task Owner must provide notice of that on the WoWtasks Platform.</li>
                                <li>Once the Posted Task has been completed and the Task Owner confirms the Services are completed, or if WoWtasks is satisfied the Services have been completed, the Tasker Funds will be released by WoWtasks from the Payment Account to the Tasker. However this process does not apply to the payment of Recurring Services which is addressed in clause 1.16 below.</li>
                                <li>After the Task Contract is completed, the parties are encouraged to review and provide feedback of the Services on the WoWtasks Platform.</li>
                                <li>WoWtasks may also provide a Search Assist feature enabling Task Owners to submit a Bid for Services.</li>
                                <li>A Bid submitted by a Task Owner using Search Assist may be notified to other Users and such Users may elect to make an Instant Claim of it.</li>
                                <li>When using Search Assist a Task Contract is created when a Tasker makes an Instant Claim (and in the case of Recurring Services a Task Contract is created for the first Occurrence only). For Recurring Services, the next Task Contract is created upon completion of the previous Occurrence.</li>
                                <li>For Recurring Services and subject to clause 1.17, once the Occurrence has been completed and the Tasker confirms the Occurrence is completed (or if WoWtasks is satisfied the Occurrence is completed) then the Tasker Funds for that Occurrence will automatically be released by WoWtasks from the Payment Account to the Tasker.</li>
                                <li>The Task Owner may elect to pause automatic payment of Tasker Funds for an Occurrence within 24 hours from when the Tasker confirms the Occurrence is completed. If the Task Owner pauses such automatic payment in accordance with this clause, then the Tasker Funds will not be released by WoWtasks from the Payment Account to the Tasker until the Task Owner also confirms that the Occurrence is completed.</li>

                                <li>WoWtasks Platform may from time to time engage location-based or map-based functionality. The WoWtasks Platform may display the location of Task Owners and Taskers / Service Providers / Service Providing Companies to persons browsing the WoWtasks Platform. A Task Owner should never disclose personal details such as the Task Owner's full name, street number, phone number or email address in a Posted Task or in any other public communication on the WoWtasks Platform.</li>
                                <li> If You are a Tasker, You must have the right to provide Services under a Task Contract and to work in the jurisdiction where the Services are performed.

WoWtasks advises Taskers / Service Providers / Service Providing Companies not to agree to incur costs in advance of receiving the payment for these costs, unless the Tasker is confident the Task Owner will reimburse the costs promptly.</li>
                                <li>For the proper operation of the WoWtasks Platform (including insurance, proper pricing and compliance with Policies), the Tasker must ensure that, if it subcontracts any part of the performance of the Services to a third party in accordance with a Task Contract, then that third party must also be a registered User of the WoWtasks Platform.</li>

                                    <li> WoWtasks does not represent that any insurance it acquires or which is Bided via the WoWtasks Platform is adequate or appropriate for any particular User.</li>
                                    <li> Each User must make its own enquiries about whether any further insurance is required and Taskers / Service Providers / Service Providing Companies remain responsible for ensuring that they have, and maintain, sufficient insurance to cover the Services provided to other Users of the WoWtasks Platform.</li>
                                    <li> WoWtasks may also take out other insurance itself and that insurance may at WoWtasks's option extend some types of cover to Users. WoWtasks reserves the right to change the terms of its insurance policies with the third party insurance providers at any time. A summary of the policies are available on the WoWtasks website and the policy details can be requested via WoWtasks. Users are responsible for familiarising themselves with these details.</li>
                                    <li>You acknowledge and agree that in the event that a claim is made relating to any services performed and/or goods provided by a Tasker, and the insurance taken out by WoWtasks (if any) responds to that claim then this clause applies. If a claim is made against a Tasker, WoWtasks may (provided that the Tasker consents) elect to make a claim under any applicable policy and if the claim is successful, WoWtasks reserves its right to recover any excess or deductible payable in respect of the claim from the Tasker. Where WoWtasks makes a claim and the insurer assesses that the Tasker is responsible, WoWtasks is entitled to rely on that assessment. If You do not pay any excess due under this clause, WoWtasks may also elect to set this amount off some or all of the excess paid by it against future moneys it may owe to You.</li>
                                    <li> You acknowledge and agree that in the event that a claim is made relating to any services performed and/or goods provided by a Tasker, and the insurance taken out by WoWtasks (if any) does not respond to the claim or the claim is below the excess payable to the insurer, then this clause applies. WoWtasks may elect to reject or pay an amount to settle a claim not covered by WoWtasks's own insurance policies. To the extent that the Tasker was or would be liable for the amount of the claim, if WoWtasks elects to pay an amount to settle the claim the amount paid by WoWtasks may be recovered by WoWtasks from the Tasker. WoWtasks may also elect to set this amount off against future moneys it may owe to the Tasker.</li>
